This repository contains jupyter-notebooks with my code for conducting research on the topic of my master's Thesis: Peak load reduction using thermal energy storage in a HVAC system of a building.

### Abstract

The main idea of the work is to study the effect of thermal storage on changing the daily profile of electricity consumption by a building (house) to reduce peak loads. Various ways of managing energy demand from both the production and consumption sides are described. The work compares different types of thermal storage in the air conditioning system: walls and inertia of the building, water storage, material with a phase transition, ground heat sources. Certain combinations were also considered. The use of various types of a heat storage devices was discussed in detail. Also, in the thesis, a mathematical model of the room was developed to obtain numerical results. The model was analyzed and showed a low deviation from the experimental data. The author also formulated an optimization problem using a heat storage device. In the process of work, we proposed our algorithm for finding the optimal operating schedule of the compressor and fan both in the case of a conventional HVAC system and in the case of setting the optimization problem for a modified air conditioning system. In conclusion, the most effective way to manage energy demand when using one of the compared thermal storages in the air conditioning system is identified.
